                <p> This August
                    2023, people started seeing enhanced bitrate options in some videos. Youtube says that it
                    will not mess with the old 1080p, but many people started seeing differences.</p>
                <p>Is there actually no difference? Were we just getting used to the 4K options that the 1080p looks
                    bad now, or is it just a marketing strategy to get more people to subscribe to premium?

                <h2>Twitter to X</h2>
                <p>On October 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter. He rebranded it to X on July 2023</p>
                <p>He claims he is aiming for an everything apps that delivers user true freedom, however, he started
                    involving money into the app.</p>
                <p>As of April 1, 2023, users have to subscribe for $8 a month to get the blue tick. It has it perks,
                    but I believe that the freedom Mr. Musk speaks of is for the rich.</p>

                <p>We know inflation is getting crazy, but is it necessary for these digital subscription-based
                    services
                    to
                    hike up the prices?</p>
                <p>Are the corporates increasing the people's salary or are they keeping it to themselves? Where
                    does
                    that
                    leave us?</p>
                <p>additionally, the competition going on between these corporates are not good for the consumers.
                </p>
                <p>do we have to subscribe for every single platforms just to watch one movie?</p>
